    <h1>Factions of the Island:</h1>

    <p>The world is frought with danger, and the natural course of things has given rise to several different factions, each with their own view on the Island's situation. 
        <br><br> Some wish for the world to return to what it once was, opposing the reign of the Knight as <strong>Guild Members</strong>. Others wish to
        hold fast to what worked and remain staunchly loyal to the Black Knight's cause after the Island's former Deity's disappearance as the <strong> Followers of the Sword</strong>.
        <br><br> Still, many Pokemon remain neutral to either alliance and join another, more minor factions, or even remain completely apolitical. All these groups are detailed here.

    <h2>The Followers of the Sword:</h2>
    <p>
    The Followers of the Sword are a cult of Pokemon that have, out of a desperation not to be killed off by their "leader", pledged their undying allegiance to the Black Knight. Originally, this vision sprouted out of a small group of Pokemon in 42 BKR/AM who did not want to be publicly executed by the Mafia, and have since signed contracts with Krueger, himself (via messages to and from his Mafia, at least- not a single Follower has actually seen Kreuger, before, so they do not know that he is the Black Knight), to hunt down those that would plague him. Initially, this partnership was just used to keep the peace and help forcibly quell doubts of his legitimacy (along with his Mafia, of course), but after Guilds began to crop up, the Black Knight found a new target, and he took this opportunity to vehemently turn the Followers against the Guilds- with the promise that he would reward them handsomely upon the last Guild Pokemon's execution.

    <br> <br> The Followers, essentially being the Slaking's bootlickers, are often contrasted with the equally-extreme Guilds. Depending on who you ask, both sides could be errant in fighting for their cause, and thus, views on the two groups are commonly disputed over which is correct. Some Pokemon enjoy the company that the battle-bred Followers bring, as while they are a bit crazy when it comes to their elaborate, gory rituals, they do not tend to violently sabotage the other "party's" work through physical or mental means like the Guilds; and others will claim that the Guilds' cause is just, as they are fighting for the same thing that everyone wants- to reunite with the mainland- while the Followers are just a bunch of delusional crazies that get off to stabbing themselves in the foot.

    <h5>The Knighted Mafia:</h5>
    <p>
    In a word, corrupt. The Knighted Mafia are effectively Kreuger’s private police force, expertly trained assassins with exactly one single prerogative: to eliminate any and all traces of the Guilds- Pokemon, documents, buildings and homes, or otherwise. They know no fear, have no morals, do not speak (in fact, none of them even have tongues to speak with, even if they deigned to do so), and will stop at nothing to perfectly carry out any order received from their Knight.

    <br><br>Each member of the original Knighted Mafia was hand-picked by the king, himself (before they even had a collective name). Before Kreuger’s transformation into the Black Knight, they were actually quite the lawful bunch- acting more like glorified natural disaster relief squads than full-blown mercenaries and assassins. But, that all changed when the Black Knight showed his true, ugly colors to the world, and the impossible-to-miss head ornaments came on. Noted only by their distinctive black, pointed hats, the Mafia quickly became one of the most recognized and feared organizations of Pokemon on the Island, as anyone who dared disagree with the Knight’s wishes was very quickly and unceremoniously disposed of. Simply put, you did not wrong the Knight or his Mafia and live to tell the tale.

    <h2>Guilds of the Island:</h2>
    <p>
    A phenomenon that most Pokemon on the Island are familiar with is that of a team- though, traditionally this partnership took place between a Tamer and their Pokemon, without them- a “team” takes on a whole new meaning when applied to the mundane task of survival, something that Pokemon typically are not tasked with on their own when they’re under the care of a Tamer.
    <br><br>These Guilds serve to harken back to these “older” customs in more ways than one. Literally the most “religious” presence on the Island, Guild Pokemon, as they are called, serve one master and one master alone- the Deity herself. The identities of their members are kept secret to everyone but their own ranks - because those that are discovered to be Guild members… well, let’s just say they don’t exactly have the greatest lives for the remaining few days they have left before the Knighted Mafia finds them. Even fellow Guild members are liable to turn on a “discovered” Guild Pokemon, typically creating martyrs that both serve to further inform the surviving Guild members of the situation’s gravity as well as further igniting the collective fire in their hearts against the Donkey Kong wannabe that continues to hold nonexistent power over their heads. 
    <br><br>Despite this anger, though, it is not often that Guild Pokemon lash out against the Black Knight’s forces- those of which are known of, at least- due to this heavy risk. As there are only two Guilds that have not been routed by the infernal Mafia, Guilds do not have potential resources and recruits that they can freely throw away in striking back against the hidden tyrant they want to eventually overthrow. They do this as being accused of being a Guild Pokemon in front of the wrong set of ears can very easily lead to having a target painted on your back and very many unwanted glares from all for the rest of your life.
    <br><br> Two different Guilds exist within the confines of the Island- the <strong>Bastion of Marble</strong> and the <strong>Gallant Glyphs</strong>. 

    </p>

    <h5>The Bastion of Marble:</h5>
    <p>The Bastion of Marble (also known as the Granite Gabion) are typically hardier Pokemon with a penchant for knowledge and debate- and prioritize misdirection, opting to indirectly setting up situations that can further cast doubt on the Black Knight instead of forcing it into them. Of the two, this Guild is much more hidden, but as such, the Pokemon are trained to hide, not fight- and they do a pretty good job of it. They are normally more survivalists, which can give them an edge in the wilderness over even the mighty Mizanite City-dwellers (who are typically famed for their survivability and stoutness). The headquarters of the Bastion is hidden within the bowels of the Amber Bypass, where the clutches of darkness will never hope to find it amidst rock and clay.</p>
    <h5>The Gallant Glyphs:</h5>
    <p>The Gallant Glyphs take a more concrete approach to their misdirection- forcibly using their mastery of telekinetics to obfuscate and scramble the minds of those that have yet to see the truth. Of course, this gives the Glyphs an actual reputation instead of the Bastion- which is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it is advised to stay away from the Glyphs at all costs (and bedtime stories about the Glyphs are about as present as those of the Black Knight) due to this hearsay. Instead of hiding and silently scheming their way into recruiting others, the Glyphs are much more forceful in their approach to combatting the Black Knight’s influence. These Pokemon study their entire lives to fight battles both in the mind and on the battlefield, and thus are typically much better prepared to fight as opposed to the members of the Bastion. Their headquarters are located far beneath the surface of Mizanite City- where the only ways in and out are a jury-rig teleportation that acts as a makeshift elevator or somehow digging your way through hundreds of feet of earth to find them.</p>

    <h3>Other Factions:</h3>
    <h5>The Crusaders:</h5>
    <p>
    An impromptu disaster relief and police force started by one young Jolteon and a couple friends of his ten or so years ago, the Crusaders are a group of Pokemon that protect the southern reaches of the Island- particularly preserving the peaceful atmosphere of the Amber Outpost for the sake of Pokemon that do not wish to find themselves in the middle of the fighting between the Guilds and Followers that inundate the rest of the Island.

    <br> <br> Any Pokemon is welcome to join the Crusaders- and their ranks grow just a little bit more each and every day- a beacon of hope that life isn't always gloom and doom on the Island!
    </p>
    <h5>The Arija Tribe:</h5>
    <p>
    The previous settlers of the Island guarded quite a large sum of secrets. The Arija Tribe lived in the southern jungles of the Island as the protectors to a sacred piece of land known as the Medu Tierra, protecting the floating peaceful paradise from anyone who was not deemed thusly pure-of-heart by the village's Guardian, Najn Tierra, and offering a safe refuge from woes gained from the northern parts of the Island.
    
    <br> <br> With both Tamers and Najn Tierra out of the picture, though, the Pokemon left behind by the former Arijas still continue their duty of guarding Medu Tierra and preserving the sanctity of the jungle. Led by the Arija chieftain's Delphox, Ares, these Island natives tend to live their own little life within the mighty jungle, praying and working tirelessly so that, one day, a solution to all the natural disasters will come.
    </p>
    <h5>The Demon Slayers:</h5>
    <p>
    The fabled Demon Slayers are what most would consider the 'stuff of legends'- war-grizzled, veteran Pokemon who could toss you across the room just as soon as look at you. Led by Aurelius, the Blackened, the Demon Slayers were formed to combat the ever-present influence of dead Pokemon's resurgences appearing all over the place, now that the Field of Ages no longer properly preserves the Essence of Spirits, leading them to eventually succumb to their former life's desires and turn on the living as terrifying Fiends.

    <br> <br> To some, the Demon Slayers are heroes- taking on invisible foes that most can't even hope to scratch and protecting civilians from being ripped to shreds by vengeful revenants. To some, they are a nuisance, putting their own interest in hunting Fiends over literally anything else and using the title of 'Fiend' to designate anyone they think is a problem. And to others, the Demon Slayers are just Pokemon that feel like getting their hands dirty.

    <br> <br> Make no mistake, though. They take their job very seriously, and it's not often you find a Slayer out and about, off the clock and enjoying themselves. Hard-knock life, eh?

    <h3>Civilians of the Island:</h3>

        </figure>
    </div>

    <p>
    There might as well be enough civillian Pokemon to be their own faction, given those that don't subscribe to any group, ideology, or pursuit and just want to live their lives to the best of their abilities number a good thirty-to-forty-percent of the Island's current population. Impressive numbers, given how pervasive conflicts such as the Guilds and Followers, or disaster relief in groups like the Crusaders, are!
