    <h1>Welcome, Traveller, to the Island!</h1>
    <p>An enigmatic island located off the coast of the Kanto Region- hidden to all those that are not welcome across its borders by a combination of mechanical and mystical forces and Pokemon. Or… at least, that’s what it used to be. Within the last century, the Pokemon there noticed a stark change in the Island’s utopian, partnering atmosphere. One day, these very Pokemon- even those contained within a Tamer’s Tamer Capsules, found themselves waking up in what appeared to be geographically identical to their home, but many wished this new reality they found was simply a malignant nightmare.</p>

    <p>You see, the Pokemon of the Island found themselves in an errant copy of the landmass they’d once called home. In this new, lawless age, there were no gods or guardians- no Deity to protect their Island nor her Guardian spirit Calypso to bolster their crops and protect their children- and scarily enough, <strong>no people</strong>, Tamers as they're called. Pokemon that had bonded with their beloved Tamers were ripped from this lifelong friendship by a very-real apparition so disgustingly abhorrent it could put Darkrai’s dreamtime machinations to shame. What was this place, and who was responsible? Nobody truly knew, not even the most well-versed and aged Pokemon, and there was no longer a Deity to stop it.</p>
    
    
    <h2>When the balance was threatened, one 'Mon stepped up to lead the world.</h2>

    <p>What's more- these were not the only Pokemon to suddenly be whisked away from their homes. Sometimes, even Pokemon from entire other Regions and landmasses found themselves waking up on the same Island- the same relentless nightmare- as those that hailed from the Island. And just like the former phenomenon... nobody truly knew what or why this had happened. Theories about a "master clockwinder" that not only uprooted the Island, itself, but saw fit to populate their new landscape with Pokemon of other Regions, too- though no 'Mon could confirm anything, and this only further added to the chaos in the hearts of the Deity-depraved Island Pokemon. </p>
    <p> But then, as widespread panic eventually gripped everyone, one sole figure rose up above the rest to calm the herds. Hailing from the forests surrounding the nobody place that was Vertum Town, a Slaking by the name of Kreuger rose to his feet- quite literally. Despite the species’ normal classification, the “Lazy” Pokemon was anything but taking naps- calling for a reuniting of all Pokemon under a single banner: his own.</p>
    

    <h2>Kreuger did, in fact, have his skeptics.</h2>

    <p>Of course, many were reluctant to accept a rule by some “random” Pokemon, but the Slaking’s inane knowledge about this new place proved to be just the asset he needed to win the peoples’ hope. You see, he’d seen a vision that had serious repercussions- warnings that had been left in the world by the gods that had seemingly abandoned them, or so that’s what he said. Justifiably, this was impossible to verify, until a group of Pokemon that had seen fit to jeer him came across a Prism Stone, an ancient relic that the gods had used as their mouthpiece since the Island’s creation many years ago. Where was this Prism Stone?</p>
    <p>It was with the Slaking, obviously. He’d found it during an excavation of the Cragrune Mines, telling his disbelievers that he would restore their contact to the Deity and their human companions once more. And with that- the only object that could allegedly talk to the gods, Pokemon rallied behind this figure, receiving warnings of natural disasters that could be prepared for in advance: Hurricanes were stopped by an army of Flying-Type Pokemon beating back a strong wind with their own, the ground was held in place during an Earthquake, and some Pokemon were even saved from their own brethren gone rogue.</p>
    <p>Many asked to talk to the Prism Stone, themselves, but the Slaking always declined, saying that he had been warned that if he shared this power, she would cut off contact with them forever. And, frankly, despite the skeptics- who was in a position to oppose him? Thus, society gradually began to adjust, scraping together and rallying Pokemon from all over the Island under a benign Slaking who did everything in his power to use these visions he was supposedly receiving for the good of all.</p>
    
    <h2>But everyone chose to live in harmony... until they didn't.</h2>

    <p>Then, one day, several decades after everything had calmed down, that all changed when the Slaking’s Prism Stone darkened, signifying that the power inside it had been lost. </p>
    <p>The one connection he had, the one hope of the people, and his bartering piece over all other Pokemon was gone forever. However, instead of accepting that and attempting to rally Pokemon by normal means, the time he had as a leader went to his head. Almost like a switch had been flipped, he became the Black Knight and began to “rule” with increasing violence. Now, instead of a benign oracle who would warn of disasters to protect themselves, he would fabricate “fake” visions said to be from the Deity and prophesy them to Pokemon. Some came true, and some natural disasters were averted- but many were wrong, eventually casting doubt on their integrity.</p>
    <p>Still, by that point, who was really in position to oppose the will of the Deity? Nobody would dare question it and risk never returning to the Island they once were. To curb that, though, the Slaking had since sent out search parties to “dispose” of the skeptics that still remained- special trained forces each donning black, pointed hats: known as the Knighted Mafia and feared by all. If the Mafia showed at your door one night, you were as good as dead.</p>

    <h2>In a world full of chaos and death, only <em>you</em> can unconver the truth.</h2>

    <p>Thus, the remaining Pokemon- those that were no longer allured by the spell of the Slaking pledged their loyalty to a resistance- formed themselves into units known as Guilds and remained as underground fortresses against the scourge that was the Black Knight. Sure, as most of the skeptics had been slain long ago, not many Pokemon still knew of the ugly secret that was the Black Knight’s “true colors,” but those that did joined these Guilds. </p>
    <p>This caused a split between the “violent’ extremists of both sides. The Slaking, who believed he’d finally gotten rid of the last of them, studied hard and use any resource at his disposal- books, patterns, and even other Pokemon's natural inclinations- to increase his ability to predict natural disasters before others and basically used intuition to make his predictions more apt, which fizzled out all of the recurring doubt.</p>
    <p>Now that the generational herd had been thinned, he’s the same benign ruler he once was. If you did not know of decades past, the “Black Knight” was just a figurehead- a bedtime story like the boogeyman to scare little Pokemon into not misbehaving. Most Pokemon were now oblivious by proxy to the fact that the Black Knight was very much a real Pokemon- and that he existed right under your nose.</p>
